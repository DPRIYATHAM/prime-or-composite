                A prime number (or a prime) is a natural number greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers.<br>
                A natural number greater than 1 that is not prime is called a composite number.<br>
                A composite number is a positive integer that can be formed by multiplying two smaller positive integers.<br>
                Equivalently, it is a positive integer that has at least one divisor other than 1 and itself.
